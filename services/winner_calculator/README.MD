## 1. Cash Game Rules

In a Cash Game, players play with real money, and each hand is independent.

### Key Rules
- Players bet real money each hand
- The total bets form the **pot**
- The player with the best hand wins the pot
- The house may take a **rake** (small fee)
- You can leave the game anytime

### Example
Players bet:
- Player A: $10
- Player B: $10
- Player C: $10

Total Pot = $30  
House rake = $2  

**Winner receives:** $28

## 2. Tournament Rules

In a Tournament, players pay a **buy-in** to enter.
All buy-ins form a **prize pool**.

### Key Rules
- Fixed buy-in amount
- Players receive tournament chips
- Chips have no cash value individually
- Players are eliminated when chips reach zero
- Prizes are paid based on final ranking

### Example
- Players: 10
- Buy-in: $100

Total Prize Pool = $1,000

Prize Distribution:
| Position | Prize |
|--------|--------|
| 1st | $500 |
| 2nd | $300 |
| 3rd | $200 |

Only top positions receive payouts.

## 3. Side Pot Rules

Side pots occur when players go **all-in** with different amounts.

### Key Rules
- A player can only win money equal to their own bet from each opponent
- Extra bets form one or more **side pots**
- Each pot is awarded separately

### Example
Players:
- Player A: All-in $50
- Player B: All-in $100
- Player C: Calls $100

Pots created:
- Main Pot: $50 × 3 = $150 (A, B, C eligible)
- Side Pot: $50 × 2 = $100 (B, C eligible)

### Results
- If Player A wins → gets $150
- If Player B wins → gets $250
- If Player C wins → gets $250

Player A cannot win the side pot.

## Notes
- If hands tie, the pot is split equally
- Any odd chip usually goes to the player closest to the dealer button
- Rules apply to Texas Hold’em and most poker variants

---

## Conclusion
- Cash Games reward per hand
- Tournaments reward final position
- Side pots protect fair betting when all-ins occur

Understanding these rules is essential for correct poker gameplay.
